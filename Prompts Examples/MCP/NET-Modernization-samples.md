# Sample Prompts for .NET Modernization & Assessment

## Pre-Migration Assessment
```markdown
Install AppCAT CLI and set up the environment for .NET assessment.
```
```markdown
Run an assessment on my .NET application to identify migration issues.
```
```markdown
Analyze this .NET project and provide a modernization report.
```
```markdown
Check my .NET Framework application for compatibility with .NET 8.
```
```markdown
Generate an assessment report for migrating this application to modern .NET.
```

## Build and Compilation
```markdown
Build this .NET project and report any errors found.
```
```markdown
Compile the solution in Release configuration and show build diagnostics.
```
```markdown
Build this project targeting .NET 8.0 framework.
```
```markdown
Verify the .NET code compiles successfully after migration changes.
```
```markdown
Build all projects in the solution and check for compilation errors.
```

## Security and Vulnerability Scanning
```markdown
Check all NuGet packages in this project for known CVE vulnerabilities.
```
```markdown
Scan Newtonsoft.Json and Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc packages for security issues.
```
```markdown
Verify that all dependencies are free from known security vulnerabilities.
```
```markdown
List all CVE vulnerabilities found in the project's NuGet packages.
```
```markdown
Check if any packages have high-severity security vulnerabilities.
```

## Testing and Validation
```markdown
Run all tests in this .NET project and show the results.
```
```markdown
Execute tests for the .NET 8.0 target framework.
```
```markdown
Run unit tests and verify they pass after migration.
```
```markdown
Test the solution and report any failed tests with error details.
```
```markdown
Validate the migrated code by running the test suite.
```

## Migration Workflow
```markdown
Assess my .NET Framework 4.8 application for migration to .NET 8.
```
```markdown
After assessment, build the project and check for compilation errors.
```
```markdown
Verify all NuGet packages are secure before completing the migration.
```
```markdown
Run tests to ensure functionality is preserved after modernization.
```
```markdown
Complete the migration workflow: assess, build, test, and verify security.
```
