# Sample Prompts for Java Modernization

> **Note:** Currently, there are no dedicated Java-specific MCP tools available in GitHub Copilot (similar to the .NET Assessment tools). However, you can use general GitHub Copilot capabilities and GitHub MCP tools to assist with Java modernization tasks.

## Framework Migration
```markdown
Migrate this Spring Boot 2.x application to Spring Boot 3.x.
```
```markdown
Convert this Java EE application to Jakarta EE 10.
```
```markdown
Update this application from Java 8 to Java 17 and use modern language features.
```
```markdown
Refactor this code to use Java 17 Records instead of POJOs.
```
```markdown
Modernize this code to use Java Streams and functional programming patterns.
```

## Dependency Management
```markdown
Update all Maven dependencies to their latest stable versions.
```
```markdown
Replace outdated libraries with modern alternatives in this pom.xml.
```
```markdown
Migrate from Log4j 1.x to Log4j 2 or SLF4J with Logback.
```
```markdown
Convert this Maven project to Gradle with Kotlin DSL.
```
```markdown
Identify deprecated dependencies and suggest modern replacements.
```

## Code Modernization
```markdown
Refactor this code to use Spring Boot best practices and conventions.
```
```markdown
Convert these servlets to Spring MVC REST controllers.
```
```markdown
Replace this JDBC code with Spring Data JPA repositories.
```
```markdown
Modernize this XML configuration to Java-based Spring configuration.
```
```markdown
Refactor this callback-based code to use CompletableFuture.
```

## Testing & Quality
```markdown
Convert JUnit 4 tests to JUnit 5 with modern assertions.
```
```markdown
Add test coverage for this Java service using Mockito and JUnit 5.
```
```markdown
Generate integration tests for this Spring Boot REST API.
```
```markdown
Refactor this test to use @SpringBootTest and TestContainers.
```
```markdown
Add parameterized tests using JUnit 5 @ParameterizedTest.
```

## Security Updates
```markdown
Identify security vulnerabilities in this Java code and suggest fixes.
```
```markdown
Update authentication to use Spring Security 6 with JWT.
```
```markdown
Replace deprecated security methods with current best practices.
```
```markdown
Add input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
```
```markdown
Implement proper exception handling and security headers.
```

## Containerization & Cloud
```markdown
Create a Dockerfile for this Spring Boot application with multi-stage builds.
```
```markdown
Generate Kubernetes manifests for deploying this Java application.
```
```markdown
Add health check endpoints for Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes.
```
```markdown
Configure this application for cloud-native deployment with 12-factor principles.
```
```markdown
Add observability with Micrometer and Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.
```

## Using GitHub MCP Tools for Java Projects
```markdown
Search for Java modernization examples in GitHub repositories.
```
```markdown
Create an issue to track Java 17 migration tasks.
```
```markdown
List all commits that modified the pom.xml file.
```
```markdown
Create a pull request for the Spring Boot 3.x migration changes.
```
