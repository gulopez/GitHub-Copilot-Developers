# Sample Prompts for Filesystem Operations

> **Note:** GitHub Copilot provides filesystem capabilities through its built-in tools for creating, reading, searching, and managing files and directories in your workspace.
> 
> **MCP Server Setup:** For advanced filesystem operations beyond the built-in capabilities, you may need to set up the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Filesystem Server. Visit the [MCP Filesystem Server repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem) for installation and configuration instructions.
