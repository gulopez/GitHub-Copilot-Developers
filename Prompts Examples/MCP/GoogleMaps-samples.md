# Sample Prompts for Google Maps Integration

> **Note:** Google Maps MCP tools are not currently built into GitHub Copilot. However, you can use web fetch capabilities and API integration prompts to work with the Google Maps Platform APIs. For MCP server setup, visit the [MCP Servers repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) to check for community-contributed Google Maps integrations.
