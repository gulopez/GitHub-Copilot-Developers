Can you help me create a terraform template to deploy a virtual Network in Azure?

Can you explain the selected template? (Main.tf)

Can you add vnet peering configuration to this template

when should I use allow_forwarded_ traffic, allow_gateway_transit, use _remote_gateways

when should I use allow_gateway_transit

when should I use  use_remote_gateways

What is the difference between using use_remote_gateways vs allow_gateway_transit


use_remote_gateways and allow_gateway_transit seems very similar, can you provide examples when one should be use instead of the other
